# Restaurant Bill 
# You will create a console-based Python program that will calculate the amount of the tip, the tax, and the 
# total amount of a restaurant bill. The program will prompt the user to input the original amount of the bill. 
# The program will then output the amount of the tax (15% of the original amount) and a tip (20% of the original amount). 
# Finally, the program will output the new total of the bill.
